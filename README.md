# This is a personal project where I implement a Wolfenstein 3D-style game from scratch using C++ and SDL, without relying on any pre-built game engine.

# The main purpose of this project is to learn and deeply understand:

# 

# How raycasting works under the hood.

# 

# How a framebuffer is built and rendered.

# 

# Writing a simple software rendering system.

# 

# Handling inputs and building a proper game loop.

# 

# 🎯 Project Goal

# 

# This is not just a clone of an old game — the goal is to understand the fundamentals that modern game engines and graphics systems are built on.

# If you want to be a serious game developer, knowing these foundations is essential.

# 

# 🛠️ Tech Stack

# 

# C++17

# 

# SDL3

# 📚 Related Course

# 

# This project is also part of a course I’m creating:

# "Learn Game Programming from Scratch – Raycasting \& Wolfenstein 3D"

# In the course, we go step by step through the same concepts used here, building them from the ground up in a structured and educational way.

# If you’re serious about starting your journey in game development from the right foundations, this course is for you.
