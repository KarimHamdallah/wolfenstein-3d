\# Wolfenstein 3D Clone (Raycasting from Scratch)



This is a personal project where I implement a \*\*Wolfenstein 3D-style game\*\* from scratch using \*\*C++ and SDL\*\*, without relying on any pre-built game engine.



\## Project Goals

\- Understand how \*\*raycasting\*\* works internally.

\- Learn how a \*\*framebuffer\*\* is created and rendered.

\- Implement a minimal \*\*software rendering pipeline\*\*.

\- Practice \*\*game loop\*\* structure and \*\*input handling\*\*.



\## Tech Stack

\- C++17

\- SDL3

\- stb\_image (for image loading)

This project is also part of a course:  

\*\*"Learn Game Programming from Scratch – Raycasting \& Wolfenstein 3D"\*\*



The course goes step by step through the same concepts used here, building everything from the ground up.  

If you’re serious about starting game development with the right foundations, you might find it useful.
